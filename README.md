### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am the type of person who is motivated by working in a positive working environment with high spirits. I thrive in smaller teams and when I can help the people around me. I am curious about my colleagues, I am especially happy if they have a different background, nationality, or ethnicity than me, and therefore a different and unique point of view on everyday life from my own.

I prefer projects with high intensity and great learning opportunities.
I have the same approach to problems and life as Pippi, "I haven't tried that before, so I think I can do it". That's why I need to challenge myself, learn new things, and see the results of our work in the projects I'm involved in. If it didn't work the first time, we'll try again.
I enjoy being able to contribute knowledge across disciplines and being able to see things from a different angle. I believe that diversity in the team gives the best results.

I am a visual person who enjoys creating nice things.
This applies both privately, where I paint and work digitally with 3D. And for professional purposes, where I often make use of sketches and diagrams to create an overview of a problem or explain a concept/idea.
